/*
* sqlite3/src/wal.c
*
** nBackfill is the number of frames in the WAL that have been written
** back into the database. (We call the act of moving content from WAL to
** database "backfilling".)  The nBackfill number is never greater than
** WalIndexHdr.mxFrame.  nBackfill can only be increased by threads
** holding the WAL_CKPT_LOCK lock (which includes a recovery thread).
** However, a WAL_WRITE_LOCK thread can move the value of nBackfill from
** mxFrame back to zero when the WAL is reset.
**
** nBackfillAttempted is the largest value of nBackfill that a checkpoint
** has attempted to achieve.  Normally nBackfill==nBackfillAtempted, however
** the nBackfillAttempted is set before any backfilling is done and the
** nBackfill is only set after all backfilling completes.  So if a checkpoint
** crashes, nBackfillAttempted might be larger than nBackfill.  The
** WalIndexHdr.mxFrame must never be less than nBackfillAttempted.
**
** The aLock[] field is a set of bytes used for locking.  These bytes should
** never be read or written.
**
** There is one entry in aReadMark[] for each reader lock.  If a reader
** holds read-lock K, then the value in aReadMark[K] is no greater than
** the mxFrame for that reader.  The value READMARK_NOT_USED (0xffffffff)
** for any aReadMark[] means that entry is unused.  aReadMark[0] is
** a special case; its value is never used and it exists as a place-holder
** to avoid having to offset aReadMark[] indexes by one.  Readers holding
** WAL_READ_LOCK(0) always ignore the entire WAL and read all content
** directly from the database.
**
** The value of aReadMark[K] may only be changed by a thread that
** is holding an exclusive lock on WAL_READ_LOCK(K).  Thus, the value of
** aReadMark[K] cannot changed while there is a reader is using that mark
** since the reader will be holding a shared lock on WAL_READ_LOCK(K).
**
** The checkpointer may only transfer frames from WAL to database where
** the frame numbers are less than or equal to every aReadMark[] that is
** in use (that is, every aReadMark[j] for which there is a corresponding
** WAL_READ_LOCK(j)).  New readers (usually) pick the aReadMark[] with the
** largest value and will increase an unused aReadMark[] to mxFrame if there
** is not already an aReadMark[] equal to mxFrame.  The exception to the
** previous sentence is when nBackfill equals mxFrame (meaning that everything
** in the WAL has been backfilled into the database) then new readers
** will choose aReadMark[0] which has value 0 and hence such reader will
** get all their all content directly from the database file and ignore
** the WAL.
**
** Writers normally append new frames to the end of the WAL.  However,
** if nBackfill equals mxFrame (meaning that all WAL content has been
** written back into the database) and if no readers are using the WAL
** (in other words, if there are no WAL_READ_LOCK(i) where i>0) then
** the writer will first "reset" the WAL back to the beginning and start
** writing new content beginning at frame 1.
